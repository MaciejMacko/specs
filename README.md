## Introduction

The purpose of the application is to help move from a nationwide to a selective quarantine of people who may have been exposed to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reasonable means.

The application is built by the community of citizens in cooperation with the Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs, the publisher of the application.

The application balances the need to preserve the privacy of citizens with the need to collect information about those who could be at risk of being infected.

The application can be used anonymously. In this case, all communication with the user is conducted using the application.

Currently the application is designed to be a prevention tool with daily health journal functions and has **no contact tracing** capabilities.

In the future implementiation after installing the app it will securely connect with other users via Bluetooth to enable contact tracing. It will record a 2 weeks history of all the devices encountered. This data is stored only on citizens' device and is not sent to any central server. Data is deleted after 2 weeks. Each person diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 is asked to send the history of devices encountered during the previous 14 days to the server. The data is then sent to a server where the administrator, based on their analysis (length of contact, frequency of contacts, proximity in accordance with WHO standards) decides which of the people he met with should receive information about the potential threat oo being exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

Due to understandable social resistance to the risk of surveillance, we place great emphasis on ensuring privacy. We won't let anyone to use this extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic to break everyones rights to privacy. The application code is hence made public (open source) and we encourage independent audit by experts.
